# School_District_Analysis HW Module 4
## Overview of the school distict analysis
The homework is to showcase our ability to use pandas by changing altered reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders while keeping the remaining data unchaged. Also, repeat the school district analysis done in modele 4. 

## Results
Since Thomas High School is listed as a charter school the district summary would not be affected. However, in the overall school summary Thomas High School losses some ground in its % of overall passing (90.630 vs 90.948) due to the removal (NaN) to its 9th grade reading and math scores.
